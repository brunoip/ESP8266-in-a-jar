A glass jar is the perfect container for a UV light sensor device and while I was designing the interior I decided to make a custom lid that can work as an anemometer.  
The project work using a ESP8266 and have and oled screen for showing the data. It is powered by a rechargable 18650 battery.  
The reading of the revolutions of the anemometer is made using a hall sensor A3144 and a neodymium magnet.
